He says he won gold medals at math olympiads in China and Russia, and it took him just two years to get a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley. Now he's trying his hand at solving a key problem at the intersection of two of the fastest-growing but most complicated areas – blockchain and AI. Hyperbolic, the two-year-old startup that Zhang leads focused on decentralized AI computing, said Thursday that it is introducing a protocol called “Proof of Sampling (PoSP),” aimed at addressing challenges with trust in decentralized AI networks. Hyperbolic was co-founded in 2022 by Zhang and Yuchen Jin, who holds a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Washington. The concept for the new protocol was created in conjunction with researchers from Berkeley and Columbia University, according to the team. It combines math, computer science and economics, deploying “advanced sampling methods and game theory to incentivize integrity and minimize computational demands across decentralized networks,” Hyperbolic shared in a press release with CoinDesk. Zhang, 28, said in an interview with CoinDesk that he sees PoSP as the next iteration of verification for decentralized networks. “People in the beginning thought there's only one way to do verification, which is with consensus," Zhang said. "Later on people discover optimistic proving and then ZK proofs.” Now there's PoSP, he said, and it can not only be applied to AI, but also to rollups, a type of layer-2 blockchain, as well as so-called actively validated services (AVSs), which are protocols secured by restaking protocols like EigenLayer. A research paper on the Proof of Sampling Protocol by Zhang and several co-authors was submitted on May 1 to arXiv, an open-access repository hosted by Cornell University for scientific papers that have not yet been peer-reviewed. According to the paper, the design relies on a "pure strategy Nash Equilibrium." That refers to a game theory concept attributed to the Princeton University-educated mathematician John Nash, who was the subject of the 2001 Oscar-winning film A Beautiful Mind, directed by Ron Howard and starring Russell Crowe. As part of the release, Hyperbolic is introducing “spML,” an implementation of PoSP built specifically for AI verification. "SpML leverages the foundational principles of PoSP to create a verification mechanism that is not only faster and more secure but also economically feasible," Zhang said in the press release. Now they just have to prove it works in practice.","CreationDate":"May 10, 2024","author":"Margaux Nijkerk"}{"link":"https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/27/google-introduces-cloud-based-blockchain-node-service-for-ethereum/","type":"coindesk","summary":"The move highlights the growing attention that technology giants are paying to blockchain, crypto and Web3 projects.","title":"Google Introduces Cloud-Based Blockchain Node Service for Ethereum","Detailed":"Tech giant Google said Thursday it will be launching a cloud-based node engine for Ethereum projects. The company said its Google Cloud Blockchain Node Engine will be a “fully managed node-hosting service that can minimize the need for node operations,” meaning that Google will be responsible for monitoring node activity and restarting them during outages. A node is a type of computer that runs a blockchain’s software to validate and store the history of transactions on a blockchain’s network. At the time of launch, Google will be supporting only Ethereum nodes. Google’s announcement signifies the growing attention that technology giants are giving toward blockchain, crypto and Web3 projects. “Blockchain is changing the way the world stores and moves its information,” Google said in its announcement. Earlier this month, Google formed a partnership with crypto exchange Coinbase to provide crypto payments for its cloud services, and in September, Google Cloud and BNB Chain announced a partnership to support the growth of early-stage Web3 startups. In addition, Google announced in January that it was building a Digital Assets Team for Google Cloud, showing its commitment to building Web3 projects.","CreationDate":"Oct 28, 2022","author":"Margaux Nijkerk"}{"link":"https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/21/mobile-focused-blockchain-celo-partners-with-ethereum-software-firm-consensys/","type":"coindesk","summary":"The partnership will allow for Celo to integrate with ConsenSys’ Infura infrastructure.","title":"Mobile-Focused Blockchain Celo Partners With Ethereum Software Firm ConsenSys","Detailed":"Mobile-first blockchain Celo will be working with ConsenSys, an Ethereum software firm that helped engineer the Merge. The agreement will allow Celo to make use of ConsenSys’ Infura infrastructure. Celo developers will be able to build with Infura, which will help make the blockchain more scalable. Developers will also be able to deploy Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dapps) built with Truffle. Truffle is a development environment where Ethereum smart contracts can be tested. “Developers can use Infura’s trusted and complementary tooling to seamlessly communicate with the Celo blockchain for rapid deployment and scaling” said Xochitl Cazador, Celo's head of ecosystem growth. The integration will also allow for developers to transact between Celo and other DeFi platforms and dapps. In addition, the partnership is intended to kick off Celo’s compatibility with MetaMask, a popular Ethereum-based wallet. Celo will also join the Ethereum Climate Platform that ConsenSys launched last week. Last year, ConsenSys announced that over 350,000 builders were using the Infura Infrastructure. In 2021, Polygon, an Ethereum scaling project, also started supporting Infura tooling. Celo in January introduced cREAL, a stablecoin pegged to Brazil's local currency, the real. “This partnership supports the Celo ecosystem’s mission by providing reliable, easy-to-use tooling for developers to build and scale their dapps on the Celo blockchain,” Cazador told CoinDesk. “We are one step closer to mainstream adoption of web3 and realizing its full potential to transform lives by regenerating global ecologies and empowering local economies.”","CreationDate":"Nov 21, 2022","author":"Margaux Nijkerk"}]
